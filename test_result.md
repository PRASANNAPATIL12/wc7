# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

user_problem_statement: |
  User requested to clone GitHub repository (https://github.com/PRASANNAPATIL12/wc7.git) and implement FAQ section improvements:
  
  **MAIN REQUIREMENTS:**
  1. FAQ Landing Page - Expandable accordion-style cards with smooth animations
  2. FAQ Dashboard Admin - Improved "Add New FAQ" functionality with proper form display
  3. FAQ CRUD Operations - All operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) must save to MongoDB
  4. Mobile Responsive - FAQ cards must work perfectly on both mobile and desktop
  5. Owner-Specific Data - Each owner has their own FAQ data isolated in MongoDB
  6. Default FAQs - Pre-filled FAQs for new users
  
  Previous problem (already fixed):
  
  **CRITICAL FORM ISSUES TO FIX:**
  1. Dashboard should show the same beautiful landing page design with floating rectangular navbar (FIXED)
  2. Forms lose focus after typing ONE character in any input field 
  3. Forms auto-close immediately when clicking any section from left sidebar
  4. Auto-save happening unintentionally instead of only saving when user clicks Save button
  5. Forms should only close when clicking Save button or clicking outside form area
  6. These issues happen across ALL sections: Home, Our Story, RSVP, Schedule, Gallery, Wedding Party, Registry, Guestbook, FAQ, Theme, QR Code
  
  User is frustrated because the same exact issues were supposedly "fixed" in previous iterations but are still occurring.
